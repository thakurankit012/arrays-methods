# Array-Methods
Recreating all array functions using JavaScript to learn and reinforce knowledge about array manipulation.

## Recreated Methods

- Filter: Filters an array based on the entered expression.

- Reduce: Stores two positions of the array, the next and the previous, in order to manipulate these data and place them in another array.

- Push: Adds the arguments passed in the function to the end of the array.

- Map: Iterates through the array and returns a new array based on the operations performed.
