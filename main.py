# the first Python language practice 
#start with Hello World created on 2-02-2024
print(hello world)
# print numbers 
print(33)
print(24)
# Basic mathematical calculation 
print(33+24)
print(33-24)
print(33*24)
print(33/24)
# variables in Python - I already know Java and C++ so I am a little bit laughing about it but ya it is also a programming language so I respect that Python is easy for beginners
# So how would I choose var i just have to give a (random)name then = value that I want to store basically in the form of data types
car = "Mercedes"  #  a variable stored in the memory of computers if you know fundamentals well;
color = "brownish"
price = 2 # Let us say 2 stands for 2 cr in numeric datatype

print(car)
print(price)
print("car") # This will assume that the user wants to print a string because it is in double quotation marks so the output will be car instead of value Mercedes

# now what is happening there is a computer stores the value in its memory they know what car value is 
# Now if I want make a sentence out of it 
print("Hey I like the usual cars mostly classic ones one of my favorite classic brands is ", car, "and I like all those classic", car," who has color" color)
# The 2n version I learned 
# Then use them in the print statement
print(f"Hey! I usually like cars, mostly classic ones. One of my favorite classic brands is {car}. "
      f"I like all those classic {car}s that have the color {color}.")
# So when we give a variable car = Mercedes so that means var has to save in memory that the car is Mercedes 
# assignment operator
# So now when I make a new var car1 and assign the exsiting var as a value so now value will be the first value its going to merge 
car1 = car
