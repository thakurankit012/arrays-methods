print(hello world)
# print numbers 
print(33)
print(24)
# Basic mathematical calculation

# variables in Python - I already know Java and C++ so I am a little bit laughing about it but ya it is also a programming language so I respect that Python is easy for beginners
# So how would I choose var i just have to give a (random)name then = value that I want to store basically in the form of data types
car = "Mercedes"  #  a variable stored in the memory of computers if you know fundamentals well;
color = "brownish"
price = 2 # Let us say 2 stands for 2 cr in numeric datatype

print(car)
print(price)
print("car") # This will assume that the user wants to print a string because it is in double quotation marks so the output will be car instead of value Mercedes
